# WooCommerce-Guest-Checkout-for-Individual-Product
A simple wooCommerce plugin forked from [contemplate](https://gist.github.com/2adc7be2c72d585a07ac6f90b1f1e1b4.git). It enables for individuals Guest Checkout for Individual Product through a checkbox from the product page.

By default, WooCommerce enables guest checkout for all the products. It would be a pain if you want to enable it for specific / individual product. 

### But not anymore!
We have made it easy for the user to enable guest checkout for individual product by just checking a checkbox in WooCommerce product dashboard page.

## Does it work for the premium plugin [WooCommerce Bookings](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-bookings/)?
Yes it's available for [WooCommerce Bookings](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-bookings/) bookable product as well!

### Usage

Go to WordPress dashboard > Products > Add New / Edit >  Under Product data section > Checkout  Allow Guest Checkout
